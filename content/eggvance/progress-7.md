This were some productive weeks for me. I made visible, audible and technical progress which brings me one step closer to the finish line. I never intended for the emulator to be perfect, hell, I didn't even know if I could do it at all. I just wanted something accurate and fast. The current version almost represents that dream state, there are just some very minor things and a code cleanup left to do. But that's all unimportant for now, let's talk about the actual improvements.
