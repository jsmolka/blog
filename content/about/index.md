What's up! I am Julian, a {{<age>}}-year-old software developer from Leipzig, Germany. In my spare time, I like gaming, [cycling](/tags/cycling/) and working on [side projects](/projects/). That's pretty much all I do actually. Lately, I've focused a lot on [emulation](/tags/emulation/), which will probably cover most of this site.
