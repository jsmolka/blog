Porsche Leipzig has its own [road circuit](https://www.porsche-leipzig.com/en/tracks/porsche-on-road-circuit), which is modeled on famous sections from race tracks around the world, and for the third time now, they have opened their doors to Leipzig's cycling scene.  Almost two hundred people showed up to ride the 3.6 km loop for two hours. I also managed to get hold of a ticket this time and rode by best one-hour power of [325 watts normalized](https://www.strava.com/activities/7420760607).
