The year of high numbers concludes with a follow-up post to my [2024 Todoist review](/posts/5000-tasks-later/). The app continues to serve as my second brain and eliminates the mental load of remembering tasks. Despite being an easy recommendation for everybody searching for a productivity tool, I have noticed some shortcomings that I want to discuss here.

1. Checklists are an ideal use case for such an app. I maintain one for traveling. It includes everything I could possibly imagine. Once the list is checked-off, I can be sure to not have forgotten anything. Unfortunately, it grew quite large over time and duplicating the list would surpass Todoist's **[three hundred tasks limit](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/usage-limits-in-todoist-e5rcSY)**, so I had to split it into multiple projects.
2. The reason for the task limit is stated as:

    > Why place a 300 active task limit? Why cap projects to 500? These limits ensure Todoist stays fast, stable, and reliable for everyone. Having too many active tasks in a single project can slow syncing down and increase the risk of performance issues. [...] That said, we're working to make our sync engine faster, so we can increase these limits.

    I hope the last part is true, because **performance is lacking**, to say the least:

      | ----: | ------------: | ------------: | ------------: | ----------: |

      |    25 |          8.15 |         11.19 |          7.59 |        8.98 |
      |    50 |         20.52 |         15.59 |         14.90 |       17.00 |
      |   100 |         29.70 |         32.71 |         31.72 |       25.77 |
      |   200 |         60.66 |         78.19 |         71.06 |       69.97 |
      |   300 |        128.09 |        130.58 |        109.47 |      122.71 |

    That being said, I never noticed any issues outside of duplicating projects.

3. **Markdown support is limited.** I would like to see proper support on the level of GitHub. Tables and copy/paste inline images are a must, while file uploads would be nice to have. Currently, you can only add images and files by commenting on a task, which decouples them from the rest of the content.
4. [Todoist will increase its annual price](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/todoist-pricing-and-plans-update-2025-everything-you-need-to-know-Tn6Pg1JKI) from €48 to €60. This won't hurt my bottom line, and I think the price is fair for the amount I use it. I support their [vision](https://doist.com/how-we-work/no-exit-strategy) of being a sustainable company without an exit strategy through acquisition or IPO. I worry, however, about the way this additional money is spent on [AI features](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/dictate-to-add-tasks-with-ramble-P1Raq7vVF) [nobody asked for](https://www.reddit.com/r/todoist/comments/1oq25gr/anyone_else_considering_leaving_todoist_after/) instead of focusing on community feedback.

Despite my criticism, I will continue to be a content customer of Todoist. I hope they realign with their community and steer away from unnecessary AI integration. Focusing on performance and polishing existing features would elevate this app to the next level. Post done --- another task completed.
