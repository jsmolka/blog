### Corona Virus
- did not affect me

### Running
- turned lazy during teengate years
- started the year betting on CS:GO matches -> impulsive

I went out with ~150â‚¬ profit and used this money to buy myself some good running shoes. I had to invest quite a sum in order to stay motivated and not back out. So I started running in early March. It was quite cold and hard to stay motivated but I set myself a goal of running 5km every two or three days. This went on for some months and I increased the distance to 6.7km because it was a good trip to make. One night in May my typical "let's overdo it" mood took hold of me and I ran a half-marathon in 2h.

266 in 46 run (5:40 pace) -> how many hours?
Half Marathon in 2 hours

### Moving (and setup upgrade)
- do it all alone due to dad illness

### Cycling
Short after moving I deciced to get myself a new bike.

- Eating stupid amounts
- Adrenaline rush
- Stupid 12km jogging back
- Recking the badger
- stats (longest, total time, etc..)

### Programming
- unsatisfied
