I tend to go through periods of obsessive behavior [^about]. Once I'm focused on a particular thing, something that really captivates my imagination, it's hard to concentrate on anything else. A recent example of this is [workin](/projects/#workin). I had to take a week of work to finish it, because I couldn't concentrate on the task at hand. No matter what I had in front of me, my mind would just slowly drift back to it. Don't get me wrong, I love my [side projects](/projects/), but I wish they weren't so **intense**.

[^about]: It's part of the quote in the [about page](/about/) for a reason.

But even finishing the thing doesn't always calm the mind. When I publish a new blog post, I tend to read it several times once it's online. I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish. I just open it at random and read it. When I [changed my logo](/posts/procrastination-project/#logo), every time I saw it, I stopped for a split second just to check that the geometry and alignment were correct. This behavior becomes less frequent over time and eventually disappears. Then I have peace of mind until the next big thing arises.

Sometimes I wonder if other people experience the same thing.
