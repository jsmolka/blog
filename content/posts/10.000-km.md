I reached my annual goal of cycling 10.000 km last month. It seemed impossible due to a slow start during the winter months, but I smashed it in the following ones. At the point of writing, I've covered 10.900 km in 359 hours, not counting commuting and other activities. This year I:

- Rode 180 km in a [single ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/5532332583)
- Rode an [olympic distance time trial](https://www.strava.com/activities/6218796328) with a 36 km/h average
- Reached and [verified](https://www.strava.com/activities/6270309724) an FTP of 300 W
- Crashed into a badger
