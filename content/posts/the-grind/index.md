It has been two months since the last progress report and the only things I managed to implement were classes and bound methods. drizzle doesn't even support inheritance. Classes are just empty husks used to store data and methods.

```drizzle
class Vector:
  def init(x, y):
    this.x = x
    this.y = y
  def length():
    return (this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2) ** 0.5

var vector = Vector(2, 4)
print(vector.x)
print(vector.y)

var length = vector.length
print(length())
```

I also bought a new road bike and guess what: cycling up to 600 km a week keeps just enough energy in the tank to be somewhat productive at work and fall into bed at night. A few chapters were remaining in [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), but those were long and every bit of tinkering felt like a grind. I managed to work through them in the days following an unfortunate [crash](https://www.strava.com/activities/7065053419). Rest in peace 700â‚¬ in equipment and shoutout to my helmet!
