I listened to lots of [Cortex podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@cortexFM) episodes over the last months. In some of them, the hosts [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey) and Myke Hurley discuss their [yearly themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE): year of refinement, year of order, year of novelty. A theme is different from a New Year's resolution. It's something broad that guides your decision-making. Something you can't fail at. Something that steers your life in a positive direction.

But what do I want to change in 2024?

- I want to organize my brain. Recently, I switched from Google Keep to [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), and it's been awesome. My brain behaves much like an organic list processor, and features like sub tasks, reminders and due dates elevate my productivity to the next level.
- I want to optimize my sleep. It's not bad at the moment, but being more strict with bed/wake times and establishing a consistent schedule for week days/ends would be beneficial. Most late nights occur when I have something on my mind I want to finish. It's never that important and could certainly wait until the next day.
- I want to improve my training. Over the last years, I achieved good form mostly with volume. I adhered to a structured plan during winter but never transferred that to the outside world. This year, I want to perform interval sessions outdoors, stretch on a regular basis and, most importantly, do core work multiple times a week to combat my back pain.

I want to bring structure to my life. This will be the **year of structure**.
