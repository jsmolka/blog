I reached my goal of cycling 10.000 km this year one month ago. It seemed impossible due to a slow start during the winter months, but I smashed in the following ones. At the point of writing this, I've covered 10.900 km in 359 hours, without including commuting and other activities. This year I:

- Rode 180 km in a [single ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/5532332583)
- Rode an [olympic distance time trial](https://www.strava.com/activities/6218796328) with a 36 km/h average
- Reached an FTP of 300 W
- Crashed into a badger

Here are some impressions:
