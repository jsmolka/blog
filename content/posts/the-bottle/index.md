The humble water bottle, sometimes referred to as bidon, plays a vital role in cycling. It comes in a more or less standardized shape [^shape] and can contain anything from 500 to 1000 ml of fluid, which tends to be a mixture of water, carbohydrates (CHO) and flavoring agents. Riders new to the sport might disregard the importance of the latter two,  [hit a wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall) after a few hours of cycling and crawl to the next cafe, supermarket or gas station to take in sweet sustenance --- the so called **bonk** [^bonk].

[^shape]: Some modern aero bikes come with integrated bottles.

[^bonk]: Fortunately, I haven't experienced one myself yet. I had some problems with dehydration, but those are relics of the past, because I tend to plan my rides much better now.

On the other hand, professional teams and riders have this more or less figured out. The EF pro cycling team churns through [34,000 bottles annually](https://efprocycling.com/culture/no-more-plastic-bottles/) and estimates the whole professional peloton be somewhere in the 630,000 bottles range. Numbers like that are caused by the way bottles are used during one-day and stage races. On hot days, bottles with cold water are handed out to the riders, which then pour them over their heads to reduce their body's core temperature and thus allow for better performance on the bike. Emptied bottles, with or without CHOs, are then cast to the side of the road or handed to spectators as souvenirs [^litter].

[^litter]: In 2021, the UCI cracked down on littering.
    > Riders may not jettison food, bonk-bags, feeding bottles, clothes, etc. outside of the litter zones provided by the organiser. The rider must safely and exclusively deposit their waste on the sides of the road in the litter zones provided by the organiser.
    >
    > <cite>UCI regulation 2.2.025</cite>

    The rule explicitly prohibited riders from handing bottles to spectators. After a few fines and outrage from the public, the UCI added a special provision.

    > Riders are only permitted to give their water bottles to spectators on climbs in the last 50 kilometres of the event or stages. Riders must ensure that the throwing of their water bottles to the public does not present any danger [...].
    >
    > <cite>UCI special provision for littering no. 2</cite>
