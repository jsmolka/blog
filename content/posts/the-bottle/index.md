The humble water bottle, sometimes referred to as bidon, plays a vital role in cycling. It comes in a more or less standardized shape and can hold anything between 500 to 1000 ml of fluid, which tends to be a mixture of water, carbohydrates (CHO), electrolytes and flavorings. Athletes new to the sport might disregard the importance of the latter ones and go on a ride with just plain water. If they are unlucky, they will [hit a wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall) a few hours in --- the so called **bonk** --- and crawl to the next cafe, supermarket or gas station to consume sweet sustenance.

On the other hand, professional teams and riders have this more or less figured out. The EF pro cycling team churns through [34,000 bottles annually](https://efprocycling.com/culture/no-more-plastic-bottles/) and estimates the whole professional peloton be somewhere in the 630,000 bottles range. Numbers like that are caused by the way bottles are used during one-day and stage races. On hot days, bottles with cold water are handed out to the riders, which then pour them over their heads to reduce their body's core temperature and thus allow for better performance on the bike. Emptied bottles, with or without CHO, are then cast to the side of the road or handed to spectators as souvenirs [^littering].

[^littering]:
    In 2021, the UCI cracked down on littering.

    > Riders may not jettison food, bonk-bags, feeding bottles, clothes, etc. outside of the litter zones provided by the organiser. The rider must safely and exclusively deposit their waste on the sides of the road in the litter zones provided by the organiser.
    >
    > <cite>UCI regulation 2.2.025</cite>

    The rule explicitly prohibited riders from handing bottles to spectators. After a few fines and outrage from the public, the UCI added a special provision.

    > Riders are only permitted to give their water bottles to spectators on climbs in the last 50 kilometres of the event or stages. Riders must ensure that the throwing of their water bottles to the public does not present any danger [...].
    >
    > <cite>UCI special provision for littering no. 2</cite>

Most teams have a nutrition sponsor that provides bars, gels and drink mixes for bottles. This post is supposed to be a breakdown of popular brands and a reflection on the mix and method I ended up with.

## Carbohydrates
Gone are the days of training with just water. Todays professional athletes push the limit of their gut as much as the limit of their legs. Absorption rates of [150 grams per hour](https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/how-to-use-carbs-for-maximum-performance/) are not unheard of and require nutritional training. Gradually increasing CHO intake between training sessions accustoms the gut to a more intense fueling strategy. Experimenting with a higher than usual intake during a race might end it prematurely on the toilet instead of the finish line. The upper limit without gastrointestinal distress appears to be unknown and most likely varies from person to person.

The recommended CHO intake also changes based on exercise duration and intensity.

<figure>

| Workout duration | Minimum g/h | Recommended g/h | Maximum g/h |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| <0.5 h           | 0           | 10              | 30          |
| 0.5-1 h          | 0           | 20              | 50          |
| 1-1.5 h          | 20          | 30              | 70          |
| 1.5-2 h          | 40          | 60              | 90          |
| 2-2.5 h          | 50          | 80              | 120         |
| 2.5-3 h          | 60          | 90              | 120-150     |
| 3-6 h            | 75          | 100             | 120-150     |
| >6 h             | 75          | 90              | 90          |

High absorption rates are achieved by a mix of glucose and fructose, which are metabolized by different pathways in the body and can thus be stacked on top of each other. In 2013, a [study by O'Brien et al.](pdf/ratio.pdf) explored the optimal ratio of glucose and fructose and arrived at the following conclusion:

> Modeling suggested fructose–maltodextrin–glucose ratios of between 0.8 to unity are oxidized with highest efficiency relative to the ingestion rate. The CHO metabolic responses were associated with a very likely moderate enhancement of mean sprint power with total- and endogenous-CHO oxidation rate, abdominal cramps, and drink sweetness presenting as candidate explanatory mechanisms. Therefore, oral CHO-hydration formulations containing fructose–maltodextrin–glucose at a ratio of around 0.8–1.0 may provide the most practical benefit for endurance athletes.
>
> <cite>O'Brien et al.</cite>

The popular nutrition brand Science in Sport launched their Beta Fuel drink mix in 2018 with a 2:1 ratio of glucose to fructose and reformulated in 2021 to a 1:0.8 ratio, [citing](https://www.scienceinsport.com/sports-nutrition/the-science-behind-beta-fuel/) the, at this point eight year old, O'Brien et al. study. Other brands like [Maurten](https://www.maurten.com/de/products/drink-mix-320) and [MNSTRY](https://mnstry.com/en/products/power-carb-heat-1-0-8) offer their own formulations based on a 1:0.8 ratio. 0.8 appears the magic number everybody is going for, even though figure 4 in the study seems to max out absorption around the 0.9-0.95 mark.

![](img/ratio.png "Integrated model for the mean oxidation rate and the mean efficiency of the oxidation of  fructose, exogenous glucose, and the composite (combined) total exogenous CHO ingested in the three experimental ratio drinks during endurance exercise")

This led me and many others like [Jesse Coyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT-PBsSLX3U) and [Dr. Alex Harrison](https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/help-me-calculate-an-at-home-maurten-drink-im-bad-at-math/801656/10) to the conclusion that sucrose, also known as sugar, might be the best option in teams of scientific literature and cost. With an even ratio of glucose to fructose it is on the other end of the recommended spectrum, but it appears to be closer to the maximum of 0.95.

![](img/sucrose.svg "Sucrose: one glucose molecule on the left and one fructose molecule on the right")

I doubt one option is better than the other at this point. Get the one that works for you, but make sure it is in the 2:1/1:0.8 range.

<!-- But the reduction in cost certainly justifies its usage -->

## Electrolytes
The other integral part of a bottle is electrolytes. Athletes sweat around [0.5-2 liters](pdf/sweat-rate.pdf) per hour. If you have ever mismanaged your electrolyte balance on a hot day, you never want to do it again. Drinking just water and not replenishing electrolytes will end in cramps and misery.

The [composition of sweat](pdf/sweat-composition.pdf) looks like this:

| Element   | Concentration in mmol/l | Atomic mass in u | Concentration in mg/l |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Sodium    | 10-90                   | 22.99            | 230-2070              |
| Chlorine  | 10-90                   | 35.45            | 355-3191              |
| Potassium | 2-8                     | 39.1             | 78-313                |
| Calcium   | 0.2-2                   | 40.08            | 8-80                  |
| Magnesium | 0.02-0.4                | 24.31            | 1-10                  |

The most important mineral to replenish is sodium. This can be done with salt, which is around 39% sodium, or more exotic options like trisodium citrate, which is around 27% sodium. The reason why one should be preferred other the other will be explained in the [osmolarity chapter](#osmolalityosmolarity).

Sweat rate and sweat sodium concentration vary from person to person. Unless you get them measured there is no way to know for sure. You can ask yourself the following questions to estimate your liquid and sodium requirement:

1. **Am I a heavy sweater?** Heavy sweaters need to drink more.
2. **Am I a salty sweater?** Salty sweaters need to consume more sodium.

I am a heavy, salty sweater and aim for around 1500 mg/l of sodium.

### LMNT
But sweat contains more than just sodium. It also consists of other minerals like potassium and magnesium. If you are a podcast listener, you have probably heard of LMNT, the science-based electrolyte drink mix. Each pack contains 1000 mg sodium, 200 mg potassium and 60 mg magnesium [^lmnt].

[^lmnt]: The unflavored version of LMNT costs 1.5€ per 3.5 g pack (429 €/kg). My version, which uses the same components in the same ratio, comes in at around 10 €/kg.

You can make your own LMNT at home:

- 1000 g sodium chloride (393 g sodium, 39.3%)
- 150 g potassium chloride (79 g potassium, 52.4%)
- 155 g magnesium malate (24 g magnesium, 15.5%)

One gram contains:

- 300 mg sodium
- 60 mg potassium
- 18 mg magnesium

I have been using this as the basis for my electrolytes during the last year. It worked great. Retrospectively I could reduce the amount of magnesium, because it seems to be a little too much.

## Flavorings
Flavorings are personal. I prefer sour over sweet. The acidity provided by the flavorings and the saltiness provided by the electrolytes balance the sweet sucrose solution. I found dehydrated fruit powders to work the best. I used [lime powder](https://www.mexhaus.de/getraenke/spirituosen/reines-limettenpulver-aus-michoacan-apatzin-1-kg) for a long time and love the taste.  Unfortunately it is quite pricey, so I did some research and came up with a [replacement](https://www.corpserevived.com/post/maximizing-citrus-part-2-artificial-juice):

- 8 parts citric acid
- 4 parts malic acid
- 1 part tartaric acid

It tastes good and provides the much needed acidity. That way I can use the lime powder throughout the day where taste matters so much more.

## Osmolality/Osmolarity
<!-- Osmolarity in mOsm/l = Concentration in g/l × (1 / molar mass in g/mol) × Osm/mol × 1000 -->
<!-- Sucrose: 29 mOsm/l = 10 g/l × (1 / 342 g/mol) × 1 Osm/mol × 1000 -->
<!-- Salt: 345 mOsm/l = 10 g/l × (1 / 58 g/mol) × 2 Osm/mol × 1000 -->
<!-- Todo: laxative effect of high osmolality solutions -->

### Carbohydrates

Glucose is digested in the small intestine and fructose is digested in the liver. Both must pass through the stomach to reach their destination. Therefore faster passage results in a more immediate and higher energy availability during exercise. A key factor in that is osmolality/osmolarity.

> Osmolality and osmolarity are measures that are technically different, but functionally the same for normal use. Whereas osmolality (with an "l") is defined as the number of osmoles (Osm) of solute per kilogram of solvent (osmol/kg or Osm/kg), osmolarity (with an "r") is defined as the number of osmoles of solute per liter (L) of solution (osmol/L or Osm/L). As such, larger numbers indicate a greater concentration of solutes [...].

> <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_osmolality)</cite>

A 1995 [study by Vist and Maughan](pdf/osmolality.pdf) explored the effect of osmolarity and CHO content on the rate of gastric emptying of liquids in man. They created four 600 ml test drinks with differing CHO sources and concentrations:

1. 40 g/l glucose, 222 mOsm/l (empty rectangle)
2. 40 g/l maltodextrin (n = 5) [^maltodextrin], 48 mOsm/l (filled rectangle)
3. 188 g/l glucose, 1043 mOsm/l (empty circle)
4. 188 g/l maltodextrin (n = 5), 227 mOsm/l (filled triangle)

[^maltodextrin]:
    The chemical formula of maltodextrin is C<sub>6n</sub>H<sub>(10n+2)</sub>O<sub>(5n+1)</sub> where 2 < n < 20. Based on that we can calculate the molar mass and the [dextrose equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrose_equivalent) DE = 100 × (M<sub>glucose</sub> / M<sub>polymer</sub>):

    | n   | Chemical formula                             | Molar mass in g/mol | DE in % |
    | --- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
    | 3   | C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>16</sub>   | 504.44              | 36      |
    | 5   | C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O<sub>26</sub>   | 828.68              | 22      |
    | 10  | C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>102</sub>O<sub>51</sub>  | 1639.35             | 11      |
    | 15  | C<sub>90</sub>H<sub>152</sub>O<sub>76</sub>  | 2450.02             | 7       |
    | 19  | C<sub>114</sub>H<sub>192</sub>O<sub>96</sub> | 3098.69             | 6       |

- ![](img/emptying-cho.png "Total amount of CHO delivered to the small intestine after ingesting 600 ml of test drink")
{.fluent}

The key takeaways from the study are the following:

1. Dilute solutions are emptied faster than concentrated solutions.
2. If two solutions have the same concentration, the one with less osmolarity is emptied faster.

The first one can be applied universally. Dilute the CHO and electrolytes in your bottle as much as possible/practical. The second one informs the source of CHO in the bottle. Lets say we go for a concentration of 80 g/l, which would not be untypical for a large bottle. There are a few ways to achieve the previously discussed even ratio of glucose to fructose:

| Solution                                       | Osmolarity in mOsm/l |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 40 g/l maltodextrin (n = 5) + 40 g/l fructose  | 48 + 222 = 270       |
| 40 g/l maltodextrin (n = 19) + 40 g/l fructose | 13 + 222 = 235       |
| 80 g/l sucrose                                 | 233                  |

Sucrose comes out on top again. If you prefer a 2:1 ratio it might make sense to use a maltodextrin fructose mixture due to its reduced osmolarity:

| Solution                                       | Osmolarity in mOsm/l |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 60 g/l maltodextrin (n = 5) + 30 g/l fructose  | 72 + 167 = 239       |
| 60 g/l maltodextrin (n = 19) + 30 g/l fructose | 19 + 167 = 186       |
| 90 g/l sucrose                                 | 263                  |

### Electrolytes
Salts are a little harder to calculate, because they dissociate into their ios in solution.

| Name               | Chemical formula                                      | Molar mass in g/mol | Osm/mol |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| Sodium chloride    | NaCl                                                  | 58.44               | 2       |
| Potassium chloride | KCl                                                   | 74.55               | 2       |
| Magnesium malate   | C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>MgO<sub>5</sub>             | 156.38              | 2       |
| Trisodium citrate  | Na<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub> | 258.07              | 4       |

Lets now calculate the osmolarity for a realistic requirement of 1500 mg/l sodium.

| Solution                                                          | Osmolarity in mOsm/l |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 3.82 g/l sodium chloride                                          | 130                  |
| 5.00 g/l LMNT (3.82 g/l NaCl + 0.57 g/l KCl + 0.59 g/l Mg malate) | 130 + 15 + 8 = 153   |
| 5.55 g/l trisodium citrate                                        | 86                   |

<!-- Homeostatis

- Osmolality: mmol/kg. Refers to the number of particles of solute per kilogram of solvent.
- Osmolarity: mmol/kg. refers to the number of particles of solute per liter of solution, whereas the term osmolality.

- Glucose: 5.5 mOsm/kg = 5.5 mmol/kg
  - Reversed: 180.156 g/mol -> 1000g / 180.156 = 5.55 mmol/kg

A solute dissolved into a solvent creates a solution. The unit for osmolar concentration or osmolality is milliosmole (abbreviated mOsm or mOsmol). For nonelectrolytes, 1 mmol equals 1 mOsm, whereas for electrolytes, the number of particles in a solution depends on the electrolyte's dissociation.

Maltodextrin is a 100% glucose-based energy that can be fast digested in the small intestine, so it is well tolerated as there is no colonic fermentation. To have good hydration, the osmotic pressure of these products should not be more than 320 mOsm/kg as intracellular osmolality is 280-320 mOsm/kg (see serum osmolality). -->
