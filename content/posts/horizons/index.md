[^divisions]: This song isn't part of Horizons. My two favorites, [Where The Skies End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DHY4cgQwE8) and [Perfect Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keMBtyjYUPQ), are part of its predecessor, the dark and dystopian Divisions. Both should be enjoyed with high quality headphones/boxes and the volume cranked up to barely comfortable levels.

Around eleven years ago, I watched a [gaming montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fli0N0RVmXw) featuring the song [My Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkll0StZJLA) by a newly formed band called Starset. I didn't know it back then, but they would one day become my favorite. Its frontman, Dustin Bates, a PhD in electrical engineering and former U.S. Air Force researcher, was previously part of a group called Downplay. He created Starset to combine his interests in [science and music](https://x.com/starsetonline/status/346082788879003648).

Bates self-describes their music as cinematic rock, [blending symphonics with electronics with guitar hard rock](https://eu.goerie.com/story/entertainment/local/2015/09/10/cinematic-band-starset-opens-for/24940226007/). The symphonics appear in the form of through-composed outros with adventurous melodies. Unfortunately, they have become less frequent in newer releases. The lyrics cover everything from love and space to the dystopian use of technology in authoritarian civilizations. Their latest album, Horizons, was released on October 22, 2021 and is the thing I want to discuss in this post.

## Songs
I wrote this post primarily to talk about how the design and creative direction resonate with me, but I can't end it without talking about the songs themselves. When listening to music, I tend to not focus on the lyrics too much. That is due to my German ears not understanding some English words acoustically and me not placing much importance on the lyrics in the first place. I listen to music for the feeling I get. Melody, flow and a good chorus make or break a song for me. Of course, I am not ignorant to the lyrics, but they play a minor role.

1. **Unveiling the Architecture**: Instrumental introduction to the album. Same as in all their previous albums.
2. **The Breach**:
3. **Otherworldly**:
4. **Icarus**: This song begins with the outro of Otherworldly
    > And he told him<br>
    > "Beware, do not fly too close to the sun<br>
    > The blaze will surely melt those wings."<br>
    > But alas, he fell<br>
    > His cries, swallowed by the sea<br>
5. **Earthrise**:
    ![](img/earthrise.jpg "Earthrise, taken on December 24, 1968, by Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders")
6. **Leaving This World Behind**:
7. **Devolution**:
8. **Annihilated Love**:
9.  **Alchemy**:
10. **Disappear**: Only song with a composed outro, something that's been missing compared to older albums.
11. **This Endless Endeavor**:
12. **Symbiotic**:
13. **Dreamcatcher**:
14. **Tunnelvision**:
15. **Infected**:
16. **Something Wicked**:

> In a search that has continued for centuries<br>
> Some far distant view<br>
> With this promise of the unseen<br>
> And it's promise of the unknown<br>
> Has forever fathered the impulse<br>
> To seek for new things in new places<br>
> New horizons<br>
>
