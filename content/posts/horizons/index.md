[^divisions]: This song isn't part of Horizons. My two favorites, [Where The Skies End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DHY4cgQwE8) and [Perfect Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keMBtyjYUPQ), are part of its predecessor, the dark and dystopian Divisions. Both should be enjoyed with high quality headphones/boxes and the volume cranked up to barely comfortable levels.

Around eleven years ago, I watched a [gaming montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fli0N0RVmXw) featuring the song [My Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkll0StZJLA) by a newly formed band called Starset. I didn't know it back then, but they would one day become my favorite. Its frontman, Dustin Bates, a PhD in electrical engineering and former U.S. Air Force researcher, created the band to combine his interests in [science and music](https://x.com/starsetonline/status/346082788879003648).

Bates self-describes their music as cinematic rock, [blending symphonics with electronics with guitar hard rock](https://eu.goerie.com/story/entertainment/local/2015/09/10/cinematic-band-starset-opens-for/24940226007/). The symphonics appear in form of through-composed outros with [adventurous and space-travel-like melodies](https://youtu.be/W7qIlpV-uwo?t=229). Unfortunately, they have become less frequent in newer releases. The lyrics cover everything from love and space to the dystopian use of technology. Their latest album, Horizons, was released on October 22, 2021 and is the thing I want to dissect in this post.

## Creative Direction
Something Starset has nailed since its inception is the creative direction. They publish lots of supplemental material and Bates even authored two novels, [The PROX Transmissions](https://merch.starsetonline.com/products/the-prox-transmissions-novel) and [A Brief History of the Future](https://merch.starsetonline.com/products/a-brief-history-of-the-future-novel), fleshing out the Starset universe.  Music videos take place inside of it and fans often comment about wanting an entire movie. There exists a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQAtvJU4ghdGGvpDfss4ZTCz5_Ns3jaAyz9r-2eR_heL96kWWZ2i9mOrEqv6SWMyXEI9OC8bGeO12Fn/pub) summarizing all the lore, but to be honest, I don't really care about that kind of stuff. I'm here for the music.

Speaking of which, the first single of Horizons to be released was Infected. At that point, nobody knew there was a new album in the works. The cover artwork features a different visual style compared to the following singles. It has a scanned-paper-like appearance, doesn't use the outlined Starset wordmark, uses less kerning for the title and doesn't fit the color scheme in general.

The album promotion began five months later with The Breach, continued with Leaving This World Behind and ended with Earthrise. The singles have a very coherent cover artwork style, despite being very visually distinct. For them and the whole album, Starset teamed up with [Brandon Rike](https://brandonrike.com/) of [Tension Division](https://tensiondivision.com/project/starsethorizons), who served as creative director and lead designer for popular bands like Twenty One Pilots, Korn and Weezer.

## Font
The font used on covers and other media is called Axion RND. It features rounded and futuristic looking characters with a small height difference between uppercase and lowercase ones. That probably influenced the decision to capitalize all text, something I'm usually opposed to. I dislike song titles screaming at me in filenames or apps, but they do look good on covers.

## Artwork
While artwork and creative direction might appear supplemental to the musical experience, they are of great importance to me. Good covers stand out and draw you in. If you find one that resonates with you, it is almost impossible to not listen to the album. That's the feeling I had, and still have, with the cover of Horizons. The LP sits proudly between my speakers as a decorative piece and catches the eye every so often.

It features the side profile of a female head. The back fades into the nothingness of space, while the front is enlightened by a mystery that unravels in front of her. The eyes look up towards the stars and the fading colors make it seems like she is connected to the universe itself. The three white dots near her temple most likely represent the brain machine interface, a part of the wider Starset lore, but something I am not really interested in.

The colors perfectly capture space for me. The black and dark blue represent the nothingness, while the electric blue and pink and calming orange and red represent the immense forces acting throughout the universe. Similar colors are used in the singles preceding the album.

## Songs

I wrote this post primarily to talk about how the design and creative direction resonate with me, but I can't end it without talking about the songs themselves. When listening to music, I tend to not focus on the lyrics too much. That is due to my German ears not understanding some English words acoustically and me not placing much importance on the lyrics in the first place. I listen to music for the feeling I get. Melody, flow and a good chorus make or break a song for me. Of course, I am not ignorant to the lyrics, but they play a minor role.
