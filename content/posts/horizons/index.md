[^divisions]: This song isn't part of Horizons. My two favorites, [Where The Skies End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DHY4cgQwE8) and [Perfect Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keMBtyjYUPQ), are part of its predecessor, the dark and dystopian Divisions. Both should be enjoyed with high quality headphones/boxes and the volume cranked up to barely comfortable levels.

Over a decade ago, I watched a [gaming montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fli0N0RVmXw) featuring the song [My Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkll0StZJLA) by a newly formed band called Starset. I didn't know it back then, but they would one day become my favorite. Its frontman, Dustin Bates, a PhD in electrical engineering and former U.S. Air Force researcher, created the band to combine his interests in [science and music](https://x.com/starsetonline/status/346082788879003648).

Bates self-describes their music as cinematic rock, [blending symphonics with electronics with guitar hard rock](https://eu.goerie.com/story/entertainment/local/2015/09/10/cinematic-band-starset-opens-for/24940226007/). The symphonics appear in form of through-composed outros with [adventurous and space-travel-like melodies](https://youtu.be/W7qIlpV-uwo?t=229). Unfortunately, they have become less frequent in newer releases. The lyrics cover everything from love, space and sci-fi to the dystopian use of technology in authoritarian societies.

Their latest album, Horizons, was released on October 22, 2021. Since then, it has been an important part of my life. I want to use this post as an opportunity to dive deeper into the creative direction and lyrics of a few songs.

## Creative Direction
Something Starset has nailed since its inception is the creative direction. They publish lots of supplemental material and Bates even authored two novels, [The PROX Transmissions](https://merch.starsetonline.com/products/the-prox-transmissions-novel) and [A Brief History of the Future](https://merch.starsetonline.com/products/a-brief-history-of-the-future-novel), fleshing out the Starset universe.  Music videos take place inside of it and fans often comment about wanting an entire movie. There exists a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQAtvJU4ghdGGvpDfss4ZTCz5_Ns3jaAyz9r-2eR_heL96kWWZ2i9mOrEqv6SWMyXEI9OC8bGeO12Fn/pub) summarizing all the lore, but to be honest, I don't really care about that kind of stuff. I'm here for the music.

Speaking of which, the first single of Horizons to be released was Infected. At that point, nobody knew there was a new album in the works. The cover artwork features a different visual style compared to the following singles. It has a scanned-paper-like appearance, doesn't use the outlined Starset wordmark, uses less kerning for the title and doesn't fit the color scheme in general.

- ![](img/cover-infected.jpg "Infected cover (Apr 26)")
- ![](img/cover-the-breach.jpg "The Breach cover (Sep 10)")
{.fluent}

The album promotion began five months later with The Breach, continued with Leaving This World Behind and ended with Earthrise. The singles have a very coherent cover artwork style, despite being visually distinct. For them and the whole album, Starset teamed up with [Brandon Rike](https://brandonrike.com/), co-founder of [Tension Division](https://tensiondivision.com/project/starsethorizons), who served as creative director and lead designer for popular bands like Twenty One Pilots, Korn and Weezer.

## Font
The font used on covers and other media is called Axion RND. It features rounded and futuristic-looking characters with a small height difference between uppercase and lowercase ones. That probably influenced the decision to capitalize all text, something I'm usually opposed to. I dislike song titles screaming at me in filenames or apps, but they do look good on covers.

## Artwork
While cover artworks might appear supplemental to the musical experience, they are of great importance to me. Good covers stand out and draw you in. If you find one that resonates with you, it's almost impossible to not listen to the album. That's the feeling I had, and still have, with the cover of Horizons, which is one of my favorites, if not the favorite. Its vinyl version is used as a decorative piece between the speakers in my living room and catches the eye every so often.

![](img/cover-horizons.jpg "Horizons cover (Oct 22)")

It features the side profile of a female head. Its back fades into the nothingness of space, while the face is enlightened by the mystery that unravels in front of her. The eyes look up towards the sky, where the stars and wider universe reside. The fading colors make it seem like she is either consumed by or connecting with what's in front of her. The three white dots near her temple are almost perfectly centered and represent the [brain machine interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4AwQGLEsE), a part of dystopian Starset lore.

The colors wonderfully express the feeling of space for me. Black and dark blue represent the emptiness, nothingness and mystery of space. Electric blue, pink and purple represent the immense energy of the forces acting throughout it. Orange and red add some sense of warmth, while the dark red adds an element of danger and the unknown. The grainy and noisy texture used in all Horizons media helps with the raw, powerful and imperfect aesthetic.

## Music
I am writing this post because of my admiration for the creative direction. It's great in isolation, but the quality of music elevates it to another level and makes it much more memorable. Horizons is quite long for a modern album and consists of 16 songs, including one short instrumental intro. In it, Starset continue to experiment with their sound, something they have done ever since their debut album:

1. **Transmissions** established the classic Starset formula: cinematic rock with orchestral elements and sci-fi-inspired themes. Some of the through-composed and long-winded outros turn songs into experiences. Tracks like [My Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkll0StZJLA) and [It Has Begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZp3Mtn-YsI) continue to be among their most well known work.
2. **Vessels** refines the sound of Transmissions. It improves everything great from its predecessor and smooths out some of the rough edges, especially in terms of production. They released a deluxe version a year later, which included some of the [best instrumental versions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7l7ekbR-9c) I've every heard.
3. **Divisions** deviates from the classic Starset formula by having a much more futuristic sound design with heavy industrial influences. The narrative takes a leap forward in terms of storytelling and discusses dystopian themes like surveillance, human-machine integration and oppressive systems.
4. **Horizons** on the other hand is much more introspective and emotionally driven. It's polished, melodic, calm and has a pop-style production, making it more accessible to newer audiences while still retaining the cinematic rock identity.

When listening to music, I tend to focus on the sound and the emotion it conveys. To me, a melodic, powerful chorus makes a good song. Lyrics tend to play a background role, which is shame, because I've seen comments comparing Starset's singer Dustin Bates to a human thesaurus. So I took this post as an opportunity to analyze some of my favorite songs. If you are not interested in that find of stuff, feel free to [skip this part](#symbolism).

### Otherworldly
<!--
[Intro]
Otherworld, otherworldly
Otherworld, otherworldly
Otherworld, otherworldly
Otherworld, otherworldly

[Verse 1]
You're like an angel's song
I'm on my knees, waiting for the sound
Stuck in a world gone wrong
So lift me up, I'll never let you down
Light like a brand new day
Surreal and astounding
The site of a mystery
But I'm here on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me to the edge and let me stay
Pull me in, I'll never push away
Searching for the words that I can say
How it feels when you're with me

[Chorus]
Otherworld, otherworldly
Sеnd a light then, I'll be waiting
Otherworld, othеrworldly
I come alive when you are with me
Otherworld, otherworldly
Far away from all the mayhem
Otherworld, otherworldly
At the speed of light and beauty

[Verse 2]
Supernatural
Like an oracle
When darkness starts to call
You'll find me after all
A face that could emanate
A stare like a spotlight
If you guide me into your space
I'll be there at the first light

[Chorus]
Otherworld, otherworldly
Send a light then, I'll be waiting
Otherworld, otherworldly
I come alive when you are with me
Otherworld, otherworldly
Far away from all the mayhem
Otherworld, otherworldly
At the speed of light and beauty

[Bridge]
I wanna become lucid
Clear, just like a window
I tried so hard to open up
And show you what's behind it
But you didn't need to hear me
'Cause you were supraliminal
Knew me without an uttered word
You always seemed to know me

An ethereal feeling
That I cannot describe
The way that I feel you
Something that I cannot hide
How you illuminate
In a profound way, I feel your space
I can't explain this place you're taking me

[Chorus]
Otherworld, otherworldly
Send a light then, I'll be waiting
Otherworld, otherworldly
I come alive when you are with me
Otherworld, otherworldly
Far away from all the mayhem
Otherworld, otherworldly
At the speed of light and beauty

[Spoken Outro]
And he told him
"Beware, do not fly too close to the sun
The blaze will surely melt those wings."
But alas, he fell
His cries, swallowed by the sea
-->
[Otherworldly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_MtK_kPtNU) is a prime example for the emotional lyrics and pop-style production of Horizons. Like most songs of the album, it follows the ABABCB structure (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus). It's a classic love song in which the narrator describes his feelings towards his significant other.

The song culminates in probably the best bridge of the album:

> I wanna become lucid<br>
> Clear, just like a window<br>
> I tried so hard to open up<br>
> And show you what's behind it<br>
> But you didn't need to hear me<br>
> 'Cause you were supraliminal<br>
> Knew me without an uttered word<br>
> You always seemed to know me<br>
>
> An ethereal feeling<br>
> That I cannot describe<br>
> The way that I feel you<br>
> Something that I cannot hide<br>
> How you illuminate<br>
> In a profound way, I feel your space<br>
> I can't explain this place you're taking me<br>

Its spoken outro foreshadows the next song:

> And he told him<br>
> "Beware, do not fly too close to the sun<br>
> The blaze will surely melt those wings."<br>
> But alas, he fell<br>
> His cries, swallowed by the sea<br>

### Icarus
<!--
[Verse 1]
Fell out of the air and you broke your wings
Like you're doing every other time
Made a new pair out of broken things
To give it all another try
And you climb right up to the highest peaks
And reach out to the edge of the world you seek
Afraid of heights so you don't believe
You could ever be good enough

[Chorus]
Go on then, Icarus, take your turn
You always fly right up until it burns
Your wings you never could change
Always the victim, into the flames again
Go on then, Icarus, take your turn
You'll never go through thеm

[Verse 2]
Head in the clouds
Buried your feet in thе ground
Telling yourself it's the world that holds you down
But you've got your chin held high
And your chest pumped up
The replica of a runner-up
You were made for skies but you called your bluff
Now you'll never be good enough

[Chorus]
Go on then, Icarus, take your turn
You always fly right up until it burns
Your wings you never could change
Always the victim, into the flames again
Go on then, Icarus, take your turn
You'll never go through them
You'll never go through them
You'll never go through them

[Bridge]
Fall back down, back down again
You've got your head in the clouds, on the ground again
Oh, looking for a scapegoat to hold your feet
Pounding on your chest so you don't feel weak
You fall back down, back down again

[Chorus]
Go on then, Icarus, take your turn
You always fly right up until it burns
Your wings you never could change
Always the victim, into the flames again
Go on then, Icarus, take your turn
You'll never go through them
-->
An energetic [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfiSaBxGB9E) about a figure in Greek mythology. Icarus and his father Daedalus were imprisoned by king Minos and constructed wings from beeswax and bird feathers to escape. Daedalus warned his son to _not fly too close to the sun_, but he fell from the sky, plunged into the sea, and drowned. The lyrics explore the character flaws of Icarus, which led to his eventual downfall --- pun intended.

> Fell out of the air and you broke your wings<br>
> Like you're doing every other time<br>
> Made a new pair out of broken things<br>
> To give it all another try<br>

The song starts with Icarus falling from the sky yet again, but he is determined to keep trying. He reconstructs the wings from _broken things_, hinting that he himself might be broken and that, without fixing himself first, he will never be able to achieve what he is striving for.

> And you climb right up to the highest peaks<br>
> And reach out to the edge of the world you seek<br>
> Afraid of heights so you don't believe<br>
> You could ever be good enough<br>

Filled with false pride, he is unwilling to learn and goes for the hardest challenge immediately. He feels compelled to seek greatness but is simultaneously afraid of it, feeling inherently unworthy.

> Head in the clouds<br>
> Buried your feet in thе ground<br>
> Telling yourself it's the world that holds you down<br>

He is described as a dreamer with his _head in the clouds_, while simultaneously burring his _feet in the ground_. He blames failure on the world around him, but is responsible for it himself.

> But you've got your chin held high<br>
> And your chest pumped up<br>
> The replica of a runner-up<br>
> You were made for skies but you called your bluff<br>
> Now you'll never be good enough<br>

He acts tough and confident, but doesn't even believe it himself. He will always be the _replica of a runner-up_, destined to be second, _never be good enough_.

> Go on then, Icarus, take your turn<br>
> You always fly right up until it burns<br>
> Your wings you never could change<br>
> Always the victim, into the flames again<br>
> Go on then, Icarus, take your turn<br>
> You'll never go through thеm<br>

He refuses to change and repeats the same mistakes over and over again, but blames the world around him for his failure, destined to repeat the cycle, forever the victim.

### Earthrise
<!--
[Verse 1]
I push my feet to the edge
I look and I face my world
This lonely scene, I take it in
It's hard to say where all of it begins and I end
And I waited for the sky to change but, oh, it never did
And I almost dropped my head and lost my faith
Then I saw you from a distance, you were worlds away
Oh, but you had me from the vision, I never looked away again

[Chorus]
I still fall for you like suns do for skies
Cerulean pouring in from your eyes
Just a hollow moon that you colorize
So powerful, I feel so small but so alive
Like watching the Earth rise

[Verse 2]
I walk these streets of loneliness
A tranquil sea on all horizons
This empty scene of might-have-beens
I stare at starless skies that call to me and I still wish
(I still wish, I still wish, I still wish)

[Chorus]
I still fall for you like suns do for skies
Cerulean pouring in from your eyes
Just a hollow moon that you colorize
So powerful, I feel so small but so alive
Like watching the Earth rise

[Bridge]
They said that we both were too different
That all of the shine would fade away
But I wish that I never listened
'Cause you pulled me through the grey

[Chorus]
I still fall for you like suns do for skies
Cerulean pouring in from your eyes
Just a hollow moon that you colorize
So powerful, I feel so small but so alive
Like watching the Earth rise
-->
[Earthrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggCkN3Sve9w) is named after a famous picture taken by Willam Anders during the Apollo 8 space mission, the first crewed voyage to orbit the moon. The original image was rotated by 95 degrees to better convey the sense of the Earth rising over the moonscape.

- ![](img/earthrise.jpg "[Earthrise by Willam Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise)")
{.overflow}

> I push my feet to the edge<br>
> I look and I face my world<br>
> This lonely scene, I take it in<br>
> It's hard to say where all of it begins and I end<br>

The song starts with the description of a lonely person. It's a beautiful metaphor given the context of the Earthrise image. The feeling of loneliness emerging in oneself while standing on the moon's surface and looking back at Earth is probably something most people can imagine.

> And I waited for the sky to change but, oh, it never did<br>
> And I almost dropped my head and lost my faith<br>
> Then I saw you from a distance, you were worlds away<br>
> Oh, but you had me from the vision, I never looked away again<br>

The narrator has almost lost faith, but ends up falling in love with a person _worlds away_. Considering the other verses, this could either be meant literally as in "distance" or metaphorically as in "out of their league".

> I walk these streets of loneliness<br>
> A tranquil sea on all horizons<br>
> This empty scene of might-have-beens<br>
> I stare at starless skies that call to me and I still wish<br>

The second verse further develops the themes of loneliness, isolation and hopelessness. The narrator is surrounded by deserted streets and tranquil seas, trapped inside an empty scene of endless possibilities. Staring at starless skies conveys hopelessness, but despite that he hasn't given up.

> They said that we both were too different<br>
> That all of the shine would fade away<br>
> But I wish that I never listened<br>
> 'Cause you pulled me through the grey<br>

The bridge describes the narrators regrets of listening ot others calling the possible relationship, because it's been the only thing to pull his out of this grey, monotonous life.

> I still fall for you like suns do for skies<br>
> Cerulean pouring in from your eyes<br>
> Just a hollow moon that you colorize<br>
> So powerful, I feel so small but so alive<br>
> Like watching the Earth rise<br>

The chorus starts with a beautiful wordplay on falling in love and sunsets. The following lines mention the [hollow moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Moon), a pseudoscientific hypotheses by sci-fi writer H. G. Wells about the moon's interior being inhabited by aliens. It might be a metaphor for the narrator feeling hollow himself. The void is then filled by [cerulean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerulean), a sky blue color, which might the blue eyes of the other person.

### Disappear
<!--
[Verse 1]
So how long were you numb?
'Cause it was cold as ice
And I keep saying that I'm okay with it
But that's another lie
The truth is I've been dying slowly
But no, not you, you just
Turned to drift into the night
A parting scene of apathy
In an instant shift to a
Stone heart, paired with empty eyes
That stared right through mine

[Chorus]
I did the math but it just don't add up
There's a whole world that used to be us
Now there's an echo calling me
Just a shred of memory
Emptiness but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were ever here
I disappear, disappear
I disappear, disappear

[Verse 2]
All is lost, slipped away
Gone without a trace
I sometimes wonder if it was real because
All that's left seems fake
Like I'm trapped within a wrong dimension
I tried so hard just to
Make you feel my pain
If you had empathy, you'd see I'd changed
But like a ghost in your presence, I dissipate
I tried it all, it's all in vain

[Chorus]
I did the math but it just don't add up
There's a whole world that used to be us
Now there's an echo calling me
Just a shred of memory
Emptiness but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were ever here
I disappear, disappear
I disappear, disappear

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I still slip
And start to question if
It was only in my mind
It's hard to come to grips
That you still exist
When it feels just like you died
So come one and all
Step right up and I'll
Perform a trick before your eyes
I'll evaporate
Gone without a trace
Off the radar, out of sight

[Chorus]
I did the math but it just don't add up
There's a whole world that used to be us
Now there's an echo calling me
Just a shred of memory
Emptiness but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were ever here
I disappear, disappear
I disappear, disappear
-->
[Disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-8n9YyfBB8) is a hauntingly sad song and explores the end of a relationship.

> So how long were you numb?<br>
> 'Cause it was cold as ice<br>
> And I keep saying that I'm okay with it<br>
> But that's another lie<br>
> The truth is I've been dying slowly<br>

The narrator is finding himself in a one-sided relationship. His partner doesn't return his affection and instead acts emotionally _numb_ and _cold as ice_. He tricks himself into thinking that this behavior is ok, but knows deep down that it's a lie, which is going to ruin him.

> But no, not you, you just<br>
> Turned to drift into the night<br>
> A parting scene of apathy<br>
> In an instant shift to a<br>
> Stone heart, paired with empty eyes<br>
> That stared right through mine<br>

His partner on the other hand is completely indifferent to the whole situation. The loss of love seems to have happened in an _instant_. The heart turned to stone and empty, emotionless eyes stare right through our narrator, not even acknowledging his existence.

> I tried so hard just to<br>
> Make you feel my pain<br>
> If you had empathy, you'd see I'd changed<br>
> But like a ghost in your presence, I dissipate<br>
> I tried it all, it's all in vain<br>

The narrator describes his partner as empathyless. He tried everything to reignite the love, but ended up failing. _If you had empathy, you'd see I'd changed_ hints that the narrator is the cause of the relationship, but this theme isn't explored further.

> There's a whole world that used to be us<br>
> Now there's an echo calling me<br>
> Just a shred of memory<br>

The narrator remembers better times, but those are just a distant echo, just _shred of memory_.

> Sometimes, I still slip<br>
> And start to question if<br>
> It was only in my mind<br>
> It's hard to come to grips<br>
> That you still exist<br>
> When it feels just like you died<br>
> Off the radar, out of sight<br>

The narrator is having a horrible time of letting go. He is mourning his partner as if he was dead.

> So come one and all<br>
> Step right up and I'll<br>
> Perform a trick before your eyes<br>
> I'll evaporate<br>
> Gone without a trace<br>
> Off the radar, out of sight<br>

He loss the relationship is affecting the narrator so bad that we he's seriously considering suicide. The song ends with the word

> I disappear, disappear<br>
> I disappear, disappear<br>

and the only through-composed outro of the album and leads seamlessly into the next one.

### This Endless Endeavor
<!--
[Verse 1]
I separate
Into the arms of the broken
Accept this fate
Exposed to the world in the open
To drift from all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I get lost in the world sometimes
Star-crossed, looking out for a light but it won't shine
So, North Star, come and guide me to you
In the wake of my own confines
I will wait for the day you call through the skylines
And I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) I'm gone without you
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Could it be forever?
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Go on without you
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) This endless endeavor
This endless endeavor

[Verse 2]
Lonely wade
Out to the depths of an ocean
A castaway
I suffer the death of emotion
Between the waves of woe

[Chorus]
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) I'm gone without you
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Could it be forever?
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Go on without you
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) This endless endeavor
This endless endeavor
This endless endeavor
This endless endeavor

[Pre-Chorus]
I get lost in the world sometimes
Star-crossed, looking out for a light but it won't shine
So, North Star come, North Star come
In the wake of my own confines
I will wait for the day you call through the skylines
And I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) I'm gone without you
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Could it be forever?
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Go on without you
(Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) This endless endeavor
This endless endeavor
-->
[This Endless Endeavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcL8i_895QI) starts out strong with a memorable guitar riff and heavy drums. The energy quickly subsides and the song continues to alternate between calm, saddening verses and a haunting chorus. The lyrics explore the loss, death or otherwise, of an important individual, possibly continuing the narrative of the previous one.

> I separate<br>
> Into the arms of the broken<br>
> Accept this fate<br>
> Exposed to the world in the open<br>
> To drift from all I know<br>

The first verse describes the moments following a tragic event. The narrator is emotionally torn apart, separated, by what happened and resigns to the pain by falling into the arms of the broken. He accepts his fate, but feels vulnerable because he is exposed to the whole world, out in the open for everyone to see. This causes him to drift away from friends and family, reinforcing the feeling of loss, disconnection and isolation.

> Lonely wade<br>
> Out to the depths of an ocean<br>
> A castaway<br>
> I suffer the death of emotion<br>
> Between the waves of woe<br>

The isolation overwhelms the narrator. It causes him to break. Go shipwreck over the endless depths of an ocean. Go emotionally numb with only the waves of woe crashing against the broken remains of a ship that he used to call himself.

> I get lost in the world sometimes<br>
> Star-crossed, looking out for a light but it won't shine<br>
> So, North Star come, North Star come<br>
> In the wake of my own confines<br>
> I will wait for the day you call through the skylines<br>
> And I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting<br>

He is lost in the world, star-crossed --- destined to fail --- looking out for a North Star to guide him through the rest of his life. He is filled with hope to one day connect with his significant again.

> (Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) I'm gone without you<br>
> (Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Could it be forever?<br>
> (Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) Go on without you<br>
> (Oh-Woah, Oh-Woah) This endless endeavor<br>

The narrator doesn't feel like himself without his significant other. He fears that he has to go on forever like this.

### Something Wicked
<!--
[Intro]
Loving
Hating
Hoping
Faking

[Verse]
I've been digging through the dirt that was left behind
I've been dredging through the mud for it
There's nothing that's alive or dead inside
In you or in this
The crucifix in my hand's a lie
'Cause nothing ever kills you
I've watered down the pain 'til the well went dry
So pray for rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And it gnawed
Rose to the top again
Back like a long-lost friend
A wretch that I can't defend
Oh my god
Is this where the dreamer ends?
Dark where the light had been
Lost at the war within

[Chorus]
And it clawеd
Back in the world again
Here for a nеw revenge
An enemy I can't condemn
Oh my god
Is this where the liar ends?
Dark where the light had been
Lost at the war within

[Bridge]
Out of myself, I can feel it crawling
How can I tell if this is the ending?
Out of myself, it began evolving
I am not well, repent, I'm guilty
How can I tell if the sky is falling?
How can I fix what there is no mending?
How can I tell if I am not well?
I've lost myself, I have come undone
And all of the horses
And all of the men
Won't put it back in place
Or bury it where it had been
When all of the forces
Have been overrun
You'll whisper, serpent tongue
What you fear you have become

[Outro]
Something wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way comes
-->
The album ends with [Something Wicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDq5TO05NcQ). Previous outro songs tended to be on the quieter side and this one is no exception until its climax. It begins calm with just a piano and then layers in strings and other instruments over the next verses. It doesn't adhere to the ABABCB song structure and instead feels like a carefully crafted narrative of a person slowly being overwhelmed by an unknown evil.

> The crucifix in my hand's a lie<br>
> 'Cause nothing ever kills you<br>
> I've watered down the pain 'til the well went dry<br>
> So pray for rain<br>

The lyrics are littered with biblical references. The narrator describes the thing inside of him as so profoundly evil, that even a crucifix can't kill it. He tried everything in his power to stop it, but had to resign eventually. _So pray for rain_ is a warning that only a divine intervention can prevent him from losing control and a sign of things to come.

> And it clawеd<br>
> Back in the world again<br>
> Here for a nеw revenge<br>
> An enemy I can't condemn<br>

It isn't the first confrontation between the two. The thing is coming back for _a new revenge_, having lost the fight once before. The narrator is unsure how to feel about it. On one hand, he describes it as an enemy, something he hates and doesn't want in his life. On the other hand, he can't condemn it, feeling like its existence is justified --- a natural part of himself.

As we enter the bridge, the song turns from calm to violent:

> Out of myself, I can feel it crawling<br>
> How can I tell if this is the ending?<br>
> Out of myself, it began evolving<br>
> I am not well, repent, I'm guilty<br>
> How can I tell if the sky is falling?<br>
> How can I fix what there is no mending?<br>
> How can I tell if I am not well?<br>
> I've lost myself, I have come undone<br>
>
> And all of the horses<br>
> And all of the men<br>
> Won't put it back in place<br>
> Or bury it where it had been<br>
> When all of the forces<br>
> Have been overrun<br>
> You'll whisper, serpent tongue<br>
> What you fear you have become<br>

After that, the silence and piano return. The narrator has lost the fight with his inner darkness. The album concludes with the whispered words:

> Something wicked this way comes<br>
> Something wicked this way comes<br>

The theme has been referenced in one of their [newer singles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2uwT_SctB0):

> Lock your windows, close your doors and hide<br>
> Something wicked has got inside<br>

## Symbolism
I included the symbol of each discussed song at the end. Starset started doing this back in Divisions and since then every released song got one. It's a nice alternative way to refer to a certain song. Lots of fan go their favorite as a tattoo. The lyrics of a song the symbol often go hand in hand. Some are obvious, while others leave room for interpretation. I leave these up for the reader to decide.

## Fin
Puh, finally it's out of my system. This was a really hard post for me to write, especially considering my lack of vocabulary and knowledge in music theory and lyrical analysis. Interpretation wasn't a strength back in school and still isn't to this day. At least there isn't a teacher to tell me how my opinion is wrong. But writing it gave me a whole new appreciation for the lyrics and their deeper meaning, something I'm grateful for.
