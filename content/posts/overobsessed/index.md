I started the year with a distance goal of 20000 km, 3000 km less than last year's mileage [^1]. Keeping goals achievable and not setting the bar too high is something that has worked well for me in the past. I knew I could do it, but still had to be consistent and put in the work. What I didn't expect was me **really** putting in the work. Long days, weeks and months in the saddle accumulated kilometers faster than I'd ever imagined. Just before the final ride, the goals page on Strava read: 6348 km ahead of plan &mdash; more than most cyclists ride in a year.

[^1]: [Kilometrage](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kilometrage) sounds wrong, even if you grew up with the metric system.
