Hey there! I am Julian, a 21 year old Computer Science student living in Germany. In my freetime I love playing video games (mostly first or third person shooters) and working on my side projects. Lately I've focused a lot on emulation, which will probably cover most of this site. The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsmolka).
