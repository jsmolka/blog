Hello there! I am Julian, a 21-year-old software developer living in Germany. In my free time I love playing video games and working on my side projects (that's pretty much all I do actually). Lately I've focused a lot on emulation which will probably cover most of this site. The source code for my projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsmolka). Let's end with some random music recommendations

- [Shinedown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnShdofsxjo) (favorite band, awesome overall music quality)
- [Sum 41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FBcBmYZmpU) (favorite album in form of Underclass Hero)
- [Buckethead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5fDjoKErOI) (instrumental music god)
