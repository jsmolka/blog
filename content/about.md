Hey there! I am Julian, a 21 year old Computer Science student living in Germany. In my freetime I love playing video games and working on my side projects. Lately I've focused a lot on emulation, which will probably cover most of this site. The source code for my projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsmolka).

Here are some random music recommendations

- [Shinedown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnShdofsxjo) (favorite band)
- [Sum 41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FBcBmYZmpU) (favorite album in form of Underclass Hero)
- [Buckethead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5fDjoKErOI) (instrumental music god)
