What's up! I am Julian, a {{<age>}}-year-old software developer from Leipzig, Germany. In my spare time, I like gaming, [cycling]({{<relref "cycling">}}), and working on my [side projects]({{<relref "projects">}}). That's pretty much all I do actually. Lately, I've focused a lot on [emulation]({{<relref "tags/emulation">}}), which will probably cover most of this site.
