Hello there! I am Julian, a {{<age>}}-year-old software developer from Germany. In my free time, I like playing video games, cycling and working on my side projects. That's pretty much all I do actually. Lately, I've focused a lot on emulation which will probably cover most of this site. The source code for my projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsmolka).
