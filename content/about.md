Hello there! I am Julian, a 21-year-old software developer living in Germany. In my free time I love playing video games and working on my side projects (that's pretty much all I do actually). Lately I've focused a lot on emulation which will probably cover most of this site. The source code for my projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsmolka).
