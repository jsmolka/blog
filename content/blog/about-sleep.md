During the last months I have read the book Why We Sleep twice. Its author, [Matthew Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Walker_(scientist)), is a British scientist and professor of neuroscience and psychology. In his book he tries to explain the various stages of sleep and their impact on the body in a scientific way. Even though Walker tries to follow a scientific methodology, most of his claims lack citations of the papers in question which led to valid [criticism](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/).

Some of the most interesting sections in the book are not about sleep itself but a lack thereof. When talking to other people about the importance of sleep I found it difficult to remember facts about the negative impact of too little sleep on your overall health. This was my main motivation to read the book a second time and mark everything interesting and disturbing I come across. In this post I want to connect the facts stated with the studies they originated from.
