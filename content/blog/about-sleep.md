> If sleep does not serve an absolutely vital function, then it is the biggest mistake the evolutionary process ever made. - Dr. Allan Rechtschaffen

During the last months I have read the book Why We Sleep twice. Its author, [Matthew Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Walker_(scientist)), is a British scientist and professor of neuroscience and psychology. In his book he tries to explain the various stages of sleep and their impact on the body in a scientific way. Even though Walker tries to follow a scientific methodology, most of his claims lack citations of the papers in question which led to valid [criticism](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/).

Some of the most interesting sections in the book are not about sleep itself but a lack thereof. When talking to other people about the importance of sleep I found it difficult to remember facts about the negative impact of too little sleep on your overall health. This was my main motivation to read the book a second time and mark everything interesting and disturbing I come across. In this post I want to connect the facts stated with the studies they originated from.

<!-- Basics -->
<!-- Discuss difference between REM and NREM sleep -->
<!-- Define sleep deprivation P225, not insomnia -->
<!-- Sleep efficiency -->


<!--
# P11
- sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system, doubles risk of cancer
- too little sleep swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry

# P35
- spider web experiment

# P67
- humans cannot sleep back which they had previously lost

# P73
- abandoning regular siestas in Greece caused a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across a six-year period, relative to whose who maintained regular daytime naps
- especially string on workingmen, where mortality risk increased by well over 60 percent
- men in still napping areas are four times more likely to reach the age of ninety as American males

# P83
- depriving infant rats of REM sleep causes
  - retarded gestational progress
  - stalled construction of the cerebral cortex
  - socially withdrawn and isolated adolescents and adults
- depriving infant rats of sleep causes
  - aberrant patterns of neural connectivity (synaptogenesis)

# P85
- infants of heavy drinking mothers showed a 200 percent reduction of vibrant electrical  activity

# P96
- study on thousands of older adults (controlling for other factors) shows that the lower an individuals sleep efficiency score the
  - higher their mortality risk
  - worse their physical health
  - more likely to supper from depression
  - less energy they report
  - the lower their cognitive function is
- every age effects if sleep is chronically disrupted
  - physical ailments
  - mental health instability
  - reduced alertness
  - impaired memory

# P123
- obtain anything less than eight of sleep a night, especially six
  - time to physical exhaustion drops by 10 to 30 percent
  - aerobic output is significantly reduced
  - similar impairments in limb extension force, vertical jump height
  - decreased peak and sustained muscle strength

# P124
- change of injury graphic

# P131
- 4 hours of sleep per night
  - 6 days: like going 24 hours no sleep, 400 percent increase in microsleeps
  - 11 days: like going 48 hours no sleep
- 6 hours of sleep per night
  - 10 days: like going 24 hours no sleep
- no signs of leveling out
  - performance would likely degrade over weeks and months

# P132

# P139
- the amygdala (strong emotion and fight-or-flight response) shows a well over 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in sleep deprived participants

# P140
- previous point might be caused by amygdala and prefrontal cortex decoupling
- those results have been achieved by a Japanese by restricting to five hours for five nights

# P141
- studies in adolescents have identified a link between sleep disruption and suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and completion
- insufficient sleep has been linked to aggression, bullying and behavioral problems in children
- sleep disturbance is a recognized hallmark associated with addictive substance abuse
- insufficient sleep determines relapse rates in numerous addiction disorders because of lacking control of the prefrontal cortex

- progressively shorter sleep was associated with 45 percent increased risk of developing and/or dying from coronary heart disease within seven or twenty-five years
- similar study with 4000 Japanese male works, fourteen-year period
  - 400 - 500 percent more likely to suffer one or more cardiac arrests when sleep six hours or less compare to normal

# P156
- adults above 45 years, sleep 6 hours or less are 200 percent more likely to have a heart attack or a stroke during their lifetime
- little sleep loss can increase blood pressure resulting in cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease, strokes or kidney failure
- one night of modest sleep reduction, even 1 - 2 hours, will significantly increase the systolic blood pressure in young, fit individuals

# P157
- individuals obtaining just <5/6 hours each night were 200-300% mre likely to suffer calcification of coronary arteries
- increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system
  - body remains in some degree of fight-or-flight
  - can last for years if untreated

# P158
- sympathetic nervous system
  - heart beats faster
  - volumetric rate of blood pumped through vasculature increases -> blood pressure
  - increase in stress hormone cortisol
- growth hormone, header of the body, is shut off by the state of sleep deprivation

# P159
- switching to daylight saving time causes a spike in heart attacks the following day

# P160
- far higher rates of type 2 diabetes in people reporting sleep <6 hours
- sleep 4 hours a night for 6 nights
  - 40 percent less effective in absorbing a standard dose of glucose (likely identified as pre diabetic)

# P161
- 4-5 hours of sleep for 1 week
  - far less receptive to insulin
- chronic sleep deprivation is recognized a one of the major contributors to the escalation of type 2 diabetes

# P162

- prefrontal cortex activity is reduced by a lack of sleep
- sleep deprived people ate 600 extra calories when sleep deprived

# P166
- epidemic of sleep is like to be a key contributor to the epidemic of obesity
- obesity sleep graphic

# P167
- 3-years-olds sleeping just 10.5h or less have a 45% increase of being obese by age 7 than those who get 12
- 5.5h of sleep opportunity cause 70% of weight loss to be lean body mass (muscle), overwise 50% from fat
- short sleep
  - increases hunger
  - compromises impulse control
  - decreases feeling of food satisfaction
  - prevents effective weight loss when dieting

# P202
- removing REM sleep removed ability to read the social world

# P228
- sympathetic nervous system

# P243
- based on epidemiological data, adults sleep 6.75h average would be predicted to live inly into their early sixties

# P244
- relationship between sleep and mortality risk is not linear

# P252/253
- alcohol fragments sleep, litters night with brief awakenings -> not continuous and not restorative
- alcoholics show little in the way of identifiable REM sleep

# P254
- alcohol study

# P259
- no other species demonstrates unnatural act of prematurely terminating sleep
- alarm clocks cause spike in blood pressure, shock acceleration in heart rate cause by explosive burst of activity by the sympathetic nervous system
- snooze inflicts this state multiple times
