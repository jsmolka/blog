Around a month ago I've attended a rock concert at Haus Auensee in Leipzig. I extended my work day by a couple of hours and then took a relaxed 25 minute walk to the location. The headliner of the concert was Alter Bridge with support acts by The Ravens Age and Shinedown.

It felt weird that the only reason for me going to the event was the support act. I didn’t know much about the music of Alter Bridge or The Ravens Age apart from the few songs I listened to prior to the concert. Shinedown, however, is by far my favorite band and I know most their lyrics in and out. It was their first time playing in Leipzig and therefore an opportunity I couldn’t miss. I was a little scared that the support act wouldn’t get enough stage time but it ended up being well over an hour.

The concert itself was amazing. Brent Smith, the lead singer, mixed his almost studio like performance with some short and inspiring dialogs with the crowd. The chosen songs were among their best and a few were altered to something I’ve never heard before, such as a heavier version of Simple Man with everybody singing along. The songs I remember hearing are listed down below to prevent forgetting this awesome night.
